## Exercise: Food Hierarchy

### Overview:
You are to design a simple food hierarchy system where different types of food can be recorded, accessed, and managed. You should utilize the concepts of inheritance, encapsulation, and exception handling in Java.

### Requirements:

1. **Base Class (Food):**
    - Private attributes:
        - `name` (name of the food)
        - `calories` (calories per serving)
    - Protected attribute:
        - `type` (e.g. Fruit, Vegetable, Meat, etc.)
    - Public methods:
        - A constructor to set `name` and `calories`.
        - Getters and setters for `name` and `calories`.
        - A `printDetails()` method which prints the name, type, and calories.

2. **Derived Classes:**
    - **Fruit**: This class should inherit from `Food`.
    - **Vegetable**: This class should inherit from `Food`.
    - **Meat**: This class should inherit from `Food`.

   Each derived class should set the `type` attribute accordingly.

3. **FoodManager Class:**
    - Has an `ArrayList<Food>` attribute to manage a list of foods.
    - Has a method `addFood(Food food)` which takes in a `Food` object and adds it to the list. If a food with the same name already exists, throw a custom exception `FoodAlreadyExistsException`.
    - Has a method `getFood(String name)` which returns a `Food` object with the given name. If no such food exists, throw a custom exception `FoodNotFoundException`.
    - Has a method `printAllFoods()` which calls the `printDetails()` method of each `Food` object in the list.

4. **Exceptions:**
    - `FoodAlreadyExistsException`: Custom exception to be thrown when trying to add a food that already exists in the list.
    - `FoodNotFoundException`: Custom exception to be thrown when trying to retrieve a food that does not exist in the list.

5. **Main Class:**
    - Create a `FoodManager` instance.
    - Use try-catch blocks to:
        - Add multiple `Food` objects (some with the same name to trigger the exception).
        - Retrieve and print details of certain foods (some which may not exist).
    - Finally, print the details of all the foods in the manager.

### Additional Considerations:
- Ensure you make appropriate use of `public`, `private`, and `protected` modifiers.
- Ensure that you use ArrayList and its methods correctly.
- Use the `@Override` annotation where necessary.
